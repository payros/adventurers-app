# Adventurer's Club CMS App

This is an attempt to create a CMS ap for an adventurer's club. This effort indends to making keeping track of awards, attendance, etc a bit easier on the director staff.

Making this ipen source allows for other Adventurer/Pathfinder Clubs to use it in the future.

More instructions on how to deploy / use coming soon.
